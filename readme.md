I had started working on this app which was supposed to be a way to automatically transcribe audio from the Lex Fridman podcast, then create embeddings 
from it and allow the user to do semantic search over the podcast content.

I found recently this app called [Lex GPT](https://lex-gpt.fly.dev/) which does a great job.

I'll put this one on the self now and go start building something else, but leaving up on GitHub for posterity.
